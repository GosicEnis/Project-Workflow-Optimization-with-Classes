# Project Workflow Optimization with Classes

This Python project focuses on using object-oriented programming (OOP) to create classes that help streamline and optimize the workflow of a project.
The goal is to simplify task management, improve organization, and enhance code reusability by using classes to encapsulate key functionalities.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Organizes tasks and assigns attributes to each task.
- **Code Reusability**: Makes it easier to reuse code by structuring functionalities into classes.
- **Simplification of Workflow**: Enhances the overall workflow by providing an easy-to-use, object-oriented approach.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
